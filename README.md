## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

lm(formula = mpg ~ vehicle_length + vehicle_weight + spoiler_angle + 
    ground_clearance + AWD, data = mecha_car_mpg)

Residual standard error: 8.774 on 44 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.7149,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.6825 
F-statistic: 22.07 on 5 and 44 DF,  p-value: 5.35e-11   

The R-squared value is 0.6825 which means roughly 68% of the variability of our dependent variable is explained using this linear model. The p-value is 5.35e-11 which is smaller that our assumed significance level of 0.05%. Therefore there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

As we can see from the above, the current manufacturing data meets the 100 PSI (pounds per square inch) variance limitation and the design specifications for all the lots in total. However, when separated by Lots, LOT 3 is showing a higher variance which might because the lots are not specific, they are chosen randomly. These metrics include vehicle length, weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance, AWD Capabilities, MPG and PSI.
  
## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
>   t.test(susp_coil$PSI, mu = 1500)
	One Sample t-test

data:  susp_coil$PSI
t = -1.8931, df = 149, p-value = 0.06028
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 1500
95 percent confidence interval:
 1497.507 1500.053
sample estimates:
mean of x 
  1498.78
  
> # p-value = 1
> t.test(Lot2$PSI, mu = 1500)

	One Sample t-test

data:  Lot2$PSI
t = 0.51745, df = 49, p-value = 0.6072
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 1500
95 percent confidence interval:
 1499.423 1500.977
sample estimates:
mean of x 
   1500.2
   
> # p-value = 0.6072
> t.test(Lot3$PSI, mu = 1500)

	One Sample t-test

data:  Lot3$PSI
t = -2.0916, df = 49, p-value = 0.04168
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 1500
95 percent confidence interval:
 1492.431 1499.849
sample estimates:
mean of x 
  1496.14
   
> # p-value = 0.04168
> t.test(Lot3$PSI, mu = 1500)

	One Sample t-test

data:  Lot3$PSI
t = -2.0916, df = 49, p-value = 0.04168
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 1500
95 percent confidence interval:
 1492.431 1499.849
sample estimates:
mean of x 
  1496.14
  
Lot 1, Lot 2, Lot 3 all have a significance level of 0.05, hence we fail to reject the null hypothesis since p-value equlaea 1, 0.06072 and 0.04168 respectively.Aand we can confirm our three samples are not statistically different.
 
# Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
Another statistical study would be doing a linear regression on city and highway fuel efficiency. With the popularity increasing and the rise of gas prices, it will be beneficial perform this especially in "expensive" cities likes San Francisco or Seatle. 
## Hypothesis
Ho(null hypothesis): MechaCar has fuel efficiency compared to competitors with the same gas cylinder. Ha(alternative): MechaCar does not have fuel efficiency complated to competitors with the same gas cylinder. We will need to collect data from competitors to complete this analysis. We would need to use linear regression, and then use t-test to understand MPG and AWD capabalities.
